<h1>7.1 Variables</h1>
<p>Variables are a way of giving names to data. Giving a name to data allows a program to operate on different data values each time you run a program. We can then ask Python to do something to the data with a specific name. If we only had literals, we could only ask Python to do something with one particular literal data value.<br>
We’ve already seen a hint of just how powerful variables are when we used <a href="../05/5_2_2_draw_function.html">mouseX and mouseY in Chapter 5</a> to draw shapes in different places depending on the mouse position. It turns out mouseX and mouseY were just pre-made variables that Processing sets up for us. Now we’re going to learn how to use variables in general.</p>
