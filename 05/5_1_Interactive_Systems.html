<h1>5.1 Interactive Systems</h1>
<p>An <strong>interactive system</strong> is a computer program that is designed to continually interact with a human user. The idea is that the human performs some action that the computer can detect, and the computer processes that action and gives immediate feedback to the human. The human then decides what to do next based on the feedback, and the process continues as long as the human desires. Below weâ€™ll describe each of the elements of interactive systems in more detail.</p>
