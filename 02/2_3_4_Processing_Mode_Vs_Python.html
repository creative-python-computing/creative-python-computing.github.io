	<h1>2.3.4 Processing Mode Versus Python</h1>
	<p>Except for the print command, all of the commands we’ve described in this section are specific to the Processing environment and do not exist in plain Python. If a command relates to the drawing on the canvas, including commands like size for re-sizing the canvas, then it’s one of the &quot;extra&quot; commands that Processing provides. Of course, these commands still follow standard Python syntax — the commas and the parentheses are part of that — but they’re not in Python’s default vocabulary. Again, this distinction isn’t going to be important for this course. Just don’t be confused if you find the line command doesn’t work in plain Python.</p>
