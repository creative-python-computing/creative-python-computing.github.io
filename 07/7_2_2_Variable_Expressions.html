	<h1>7.2.2 Variables as Expressions</h1>
	<p>Just like a single literal, a single variable is an expression all by itself. The value of such an expression is the data value that the variable refers to. So if we tell Python to print a variable to the console, it will display the value of that variable.</p>
<div class="linkContainer">

</div>
<p>The code above will print 10 to the console.</p>
	<p>Since variables can be expressions (they evaluate to a value), they can actually go on the right side of an assignment command, like so:</p>
	<p><img src="../07_Images/variable_equivalence.jpg" width="668" height="80" alt=""/></p>
	<p>After executing the code above in Python, both x and y will refer to the value 10. It’s important to note that the statement y = x doesn’t establish any kind of permanent equivalence between x and y. It just associates y with whatever value is associated with x at the time that the statement is executed. For example, consider the following code:</p>
<div class="linkContainer">
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/07365495f7" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
	<p>This program will print first a 2 then a 10 to the console. The value of y didn’t change just because x later got associated with a new value. This is definitely true with atomic data. The situation is a bit more complicated when we start dealing with lists, but we will deal with that a little later.</p>
