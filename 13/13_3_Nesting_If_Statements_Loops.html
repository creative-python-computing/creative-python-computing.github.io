	<h1>13.3 Nesting If-Statements and Loops</h1>
	<p>We can combine any number of if-statements and loops in any order that we like. Consider the
following program, which prints out appropriately timed messages for a rocket lift-off:</p>
	<div>
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/68cc7d0b41" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
	<p>For each iteration of the for-loop, the countdown variable refers to a different value (starts at 10 and
counts down to 1). No matter what its value, countdown is printed to the console with each iteration.
Then, depending on the value that countdown has for a particular iteration, an additional message
maybe printed as well.<br>
In this next example, we have two different loops under two different branches of a conditional
statement:</p>
<div>
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/d5d7b10369" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>Here, because we used an if/else structure, the program will execute only one of the two loops. If
the count_up variable is True, the program will print Counting up and display the numbers from
1 to 10 in ascending order. If instead count_up is False, the upward-counting block wonâ€™t even be
examined, and instead, the program will print Counting down! and display the numbers from 10 to
1 in descending order.</p>
