	<h1>14.0 Compound Data Review</h1>
	<blockquote>Compound data is "data that can be subdivided into smaller pieces of data which are organized in a
particular way. An example of compound data is a list. A list consists of several pieces of data
		which have a specific ordering." (Introduction to Creative Computing, Long, p.48)</blockquote>
<h2>Types of Compound Data</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>String - sequences of characters and are usually used to store text.</li>
	  <li>Dictionary - key-value pairs in no particular order</li>
	  <li>List - a sequence of data items that can be changed (called arrays in other programming
	    languages)</li>
	  <li>Tuple - a sequence of data items that cannot be changed (covered in CS 30)</li>
</ul>
