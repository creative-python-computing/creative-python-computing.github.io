	<h1>9.5 Comments</h1>
	<p>You should use comments to document code as itâ€™s written. It is important to document your code so that you, and any readers, can understand it. When you or someone else reads a comment, they should be able to easily understand the code the comment applies to and how it fits in with the rest of your code.<br>
    Some points to remember when adding comments:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Limit the line length of comments and docstrings to 79 characters.</li>
	  <li>Use complete sentences, starting with a capital letter.</li>
	  <li>Make sure to update comments as your code changes (it's easier to remember what is<br>
	    happening)</li>
</ul>
