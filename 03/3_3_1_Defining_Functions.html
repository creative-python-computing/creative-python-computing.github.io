<h1>3.3.1 Defining Functions: The def Statement</h1>
	<p>In Python, we define functions by writing the keyword def (an abbreviation of define). A <strong>keyword</strong> is a name we give to words in a programming language that have special meaning. Up until now, you might have thought that words like print and line were Python keywords, but they werenâ€™t: they were just function names. Keywords cannot be used as function names, or as anything else for that matter, except for the particular purpose defined by the programming language.</p>
