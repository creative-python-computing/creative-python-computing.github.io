<h1>10.1.3 Return Statements Versus System Feedback</h1>
	<p>We <a href="../03/3_1_Functions_Abstraction.html">mentioned back in Chapter 3</a> that drawing a line or printing text to the computer’s monitor
doesn't count as "function output." That's because function output is done via the return keyword,
and we can only return data that way. So, for example, "Make a red circle appear on the
monitor” isn’t data; it’s a command. As such, there's a distinction between function output,
which is just data that the computer passes around to itself, and system feedback, which is the
manipulation of the computer’s peripheral devices to give information to a human user.</p>
