  (a) Explore the benefits of using built-in and user-defined functions.<br>
(d) Develop user-defined functions that utilize argument passing.</p>
<p>Read the chapter for how functions can be used to clarify a program. Use these tips and the other skills you have learned to draw one of the following in Processing:</p>
<ul> <li>snowman</li>
	<li> bunny</li>
	<li> propose an image for approval by your teacher</li>
</ul>
  <p>The code and resulting picture must include the following:</p>
<ul><li>All shapes are used (line, ellipse or circle, rectangle or square)</li>
	<li>The image can be easily identified (you can tell what the picture is)</li>
	<li>At least one function with parameters is used</li>
	<li>All functions are called properly</li>
	<li>All function work as intended</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the code must be properly documented with sufficient comments and docstrings for all functions.</p>
