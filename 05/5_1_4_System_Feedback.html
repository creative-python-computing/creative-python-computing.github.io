<h1>5.1.4 System Feedback</h1>
<p><strong>System feedback</strong> is the mechanism by which the system gives information back to the human user done using a medium that the human user can access. The vast majority of system feedback is visual and is achieved by displaying information on the computer’s monitor. Sometimes audible feedback is used as well, such as the computer making a “ding” sound when the user clicks a button (or perhaps fails to click a button). Once the user has this feedback, they can use it as they please to inform their planning and decision-making as they continue to interact with the system.</p>
