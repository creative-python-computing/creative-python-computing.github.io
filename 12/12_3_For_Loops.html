<h1>12.3 For-Loops</h1>
	<p>A <strong>for-loop</strong> is another kind of loop in Python that conveniently allows us to do something to each item
in a sequence. For example, you might recall from <a href="../06/6_1_2_Compound_Data.html">Chapter 6 </a> that strings are a compound data type
comprised of a sequence of characters. A for-loop makes it very easy for us to access those characters,
one at a time, and do something with each one before moving on to the next character.</p>
	<p>For example, if we wanted to display all the characters in a string in a diagonal line on the
	  canvas. The following program would do just that:</p>
	<div class="linkContainer">
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/1ad3bb9daf" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>The executed block follows the for-loop once for each character in the string word; when the
block is repeated, the variable letter refers to the next character in the string.</p>
<p>In general, the syntax of a for-loop consists of the word for, followed by a variable name,
  followed by the keyword in, followed by a sequence, followed by a colon, followed by a block:</p>

	<p>When we do something for each element of a sequence, we say that we are <strong>iterating</strong> over the
sequence.</p>
