	<h1>13.4 Multiple Layers of Nesting</h1>
	<p>There’s no limit as to how deeply we can nest our programming constructs. For example, we can
extend our alphabet-printing program from earlier to print as many letter combinations as we like just
by adding extra loops. This version prints out all possible quadruplets of letters from the alphabet:</p>

</div>
	<p>The above program might not run because it takes so much computing power. Here's a video of it:</p>

	<p>Sometimes, a single Boolean expression can replace multiple layers of nesting. The following
two programs are an example of this. They have the same behaviour, but the program
13.3 uses multiple nested if-statements, while program 13.4 uses a single if-statement with the
conditions from 13.3’s nested-if statements expressed as a single Boolean expression.</p>

<p>In this case, neither of these programs are necessarily more “correct” than the other; it’s a matter of
which one is easier for a human reader to understand. For now, the point is to show a programming
language is like a natural language, in there are often many ways to express the same idea.</p>
