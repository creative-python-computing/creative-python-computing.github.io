	<h1>13.2 Nesting Loops</h1>
	<p>Loops that contain other loops are a common and valuable tool in computer science. The key thing
to keep in mind here is that any loop(s) on the inside of another loop will execute entirely for every
single iteration of the &quot;outer&quot; loop!</p>
	<p>Let’s consider an example. Suppose we want to print out all pairs of 26 letters in the English
	  alphabet, i.e. (aa, ab, ac...az, ba, bb, bc. zy, zz). If we manually write out every pairing’s print()
	  statement, we would need 26<sup>2</sup> = 676 print() statements. We don’t want to do that! Using nested
	  loops, we can get the job done in just a few lines of code:</p>

</div>
<p>We know from the length of the alphabet string that the first (outer) for-loop will execute precisely
26 times. During the first iteration of the loop, letter1 will be set to a. Then, we enter the second
(inner) for-loop and iterate through it. The variable letter2 will also cycle through all 26 letters
of alphabet. For each letter2, we concatenate it together with letter1 and print the resulting
string to the console. So letter1 doesn't change because it all happens during the first iteration of the
outer loop! Once the inner loop finishes its 26 iterations, we hit the end of the outer loop for the
first time, at which point letter1 becomes b for the next iteration. The entire inner loop will
repeat, with the only difference being that letter1 is now b instead of a. The inner loop will
continue to repeat its iterations until the outer loop completes cycling through its iteration of
alphabet’s characters.</p>
