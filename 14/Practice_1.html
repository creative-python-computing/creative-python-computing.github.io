	<ol>
	  <li><strong>Names:</strong> Store the names of a few of your friends in a list called names. Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.</li>
	  <li><strong>Greetings:</strong> Start with the list you used in question 1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.</li>
	  <li><strong>Your Own List:</strong> Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”</li>
