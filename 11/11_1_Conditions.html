<h1>11.1 Conditions</h1>
	<p>A condition is an expression that evaluates to one of two values: True or False. You may recall
from<a href="../06/6_1_3_Data_Types.html"> Chapter 6</a> that we mentioned the Boolean data type; that’s the type of data needed to evaluate a
conditional statement.<br>
The absolute simplest condition is just a literal Boolean value all by itself (True or False). But if that’s all we
had, we couldn't write very interesting or helpful conditions. So we're going to introduce some
operators that we can use to build expressions that produce Boolean values and are suitable for use as
conditions.</p>
