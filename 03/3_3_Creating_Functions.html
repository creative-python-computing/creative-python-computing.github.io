	<h1>3.3 Creating Functions</h1>
	<p>The ability to create functions and create abstractions of your algorithms is a tremendously powerful feature in any programming language. The main reasons for writing functions are for the abstraction and decomposition of large programs into manageable pieces. We can give names to our algorithms and abstract away their details by writing them as functions. The purpose of this section is to learn how to do this in Python.</p>
