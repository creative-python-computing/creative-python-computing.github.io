	<h1>6.1.3 Data Types</h1>
	<p>In a computer program, every piece of data, compound or atomic, has a data type. For one last moment, let us recall that data in a computer is, at a low level of abstraction that we don’t usually worry about, made up of binary 0’s and 1’s (we call such numbers bits). The data type of a piece of data tells the computer how to interpret those bits. For example, one can interpret the same sequence of 0’s and 1’s as a character (or letter) from your keyboard, or as a whole or fractional number. The computer needs to know which interpretation to choose, so that’s why Python and most other programming languages have a notion of data types.</p>
	<h2>Atomic Data Types</h2>
	<p>In this section, we describe the most commonly used atomic data types in Python.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Integer</strong> data are whole numbers, that is, numbers without a fractional component. Integers include both positive and negative numbers, as well as the number zero. In Python, there is no limit to the size of an integer number.</li>
	  <li><strong>Floating-point</strong> data are real numbers, that is, numbers that are not necessarily whole numbers, such as the number 42.5. Floating-point data in Python, and any other language, have limited precision, and limited range, meaning that numbers with infinite representations, such as 1/3=0.33333..., √2, or π, cannot be represented exactly, and we can’t represent numbers that are too big either. In Python, floating-point numbers can range between 10-308 to 10308 (positive or negative) with at most 16 to 17 digits of precision. For brevity, we will sometimes refer to floating-point numbers simply as <strong>floats</strong>.</li>
	  <li><strong>Boolean</strong> data can only be one of two values: True or False. Note again that capitalization matters – true and false are not valid boolean values.</li>
</ul>
	<h2>Compound Data Types</h2>
	<p>In this section, we briefly describe some of the standard compound data types built into Python. However, we will save the details of most of these until later chapters.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Strings</strong> are sequences of characters (e.g. letters of the alphabet, digits, and punctuation) and are usually used to store text. We’ll say more about strings and characters later in this chapter.</li>
		<li><strong>Lists</strong> are a sequence of data items. Each item in a list can be of any data type.</li>
		<li>A <strong>dictionary</strong> consists of key-value pairs in no particular order. You can look up values by their key.</li>
	</ul>
