	<h1>12.1 Repetition in Processing</h1>
	<p>With Processing, we’ve been using repetition in many of our programs. The draw() function itself is
an example of repetition: it gets called repeatedly so long as our interactive program is running.
Unfortunately, programmers don't have much control over how or when that repetition happens
because Processing does it automatically for us. In this chapter, we’ll learn how to use more
general-purpose repetition in our programs.</p>
