<h1>11.0 Conditional Branching</h1>
	<p><a href="../01/1_4_Control_Flow_Algorithms.html">Way back in Chapter 1</a>, we introduced the idea of <strong>control statements</strong>, which are statements in an
algorithm that tells us under what conditions other actions are carried out. For example, the following
plain English algorithm uses a control statement:</p>
	<p><img src="../11_Images/doorknob.jpg" width="565" height="145" alt=""/></p>
<p>Consider the algorithm as a diagram:</p>
<p><img src="../11_Images/doorknob_flowchart.jpg" width="471" height="437" alt=""/></p>
	<p>You can see at the question "Is the door locked?" that the algorithm branches off into two choices:
Yes or No (True or False could also be in place). Programming languages like Python use True or
False to tell us if a condition statisfies a specified relationship.<br>
		The algorithm accommodates different situations by allowing whoever follows the algorithm to act
differently based on their circumstances. For example, we, the algorithm writers, do not know in
advance whether our audience for this algorithm will be dealing with locked or unlocked doors, so
we write the algorithm such that it can handle either case. Handling multiple cases is called
conditional branching because, depending on certain conditions, different algorithm branches
will be followed when it is executed.<br>
In this chapter, we will learn how to use conditional branching in Python.</p>
