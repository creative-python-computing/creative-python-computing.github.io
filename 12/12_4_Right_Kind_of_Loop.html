	<h1>12.4 Choosing the Right Kind of Loop</h1>
	<p>Generally, for-loops are what you want to use to iterate over a sequence. Both for-loops and
while-loops are appropriate for simple counting loops. You may prefer using for-loops with ranges
for counting purposes because it requires less typing than the equivalent while-loop. For most
other non-counting loops that have complicated loop conditions and/or donâ€™t involve iterating over
sequences, while-loops are likely the best choice.</p>
