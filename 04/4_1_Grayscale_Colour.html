	<h1>4.1 Grayscale Colour</h1>
	<p>The simplest form of digital colour is the grayscale colour model. In <strong>grayscale</strong>, vibrant colours that you know and love, like blue, red, yellow and so on, don’t exist. There’s only black and white, and in between them, various shades of gray.</p>
	<p>In Processing, and on computers more generally, numbers represent colour. A single whole number in the inclusive range of 0 to 255 represents a grayscale colour. On the scale of 0 to 255, 0 means black, 255 means white, and all the values in between represent increasingly light shades of gray.</p>
