	<h1>5.1.3 User Actions</h1>
	<p><strong>User actions</strong> are physical events initiated by the user that the interactive system is able to detect. Moving the mouse or pressing the spacebar key are examples of user actions. Scratching the back of your head is not a user action, because the computer has no idea that you did it. The purpose of a user action is to communicate something to the computer or to tell it to perform some task.</p>
