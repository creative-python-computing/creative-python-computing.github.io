	<h1>13.1 Nesting If-Statements</h1>
	<p>Here’s a simple example of using an if-statement inside another if-statement:</p>
	<div class="linkContainer">
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/7908ca890e" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
	<p>Notice that the second if-statement is part of the block associated with the first if-statement
(indented). The line print("Would you like a cookie?") is indented again because it is
associated with the second if-statement. As a result, if last_name has the value "Monster" and
first_name has the value "Cookie," then both print() statements will be executed when the
program is run. On the other hand, if last_name has the value "Monster" and first_name has
some value other than "Cookie," then the program executes the first print() statement ("Welcome
home, Mr. Monster."), but the second will not.</p>
	<p>So what happens if last_name isn’t set to "Monster," but first_name is set to "Cookie"?
	  In such a case, the program will execute neither print() statement. Recall the behaviour of an ifstatement:
	  if the if statement's condition is False, then the entire block associated with the ifstatement
	  is skipped over. Since the second if-statement is part of the block that is being ignored, its
	  associated condition happens to be True is irrelevant; the computer won’t even check.
	  When we combine nested if-statements with else (or elif) statements, paying attention to
	  indentation becomes very important. Consider the following two programs:</p>
<div class="linkContainer">
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/e25a6a864f" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/ef191b30f0" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	
	</div>
<p>The programs are identical except for the indentation of the else statement and its associated block.
For listing 13.1, the program will declare a burglar whenever last_name is not equal to
"Monster," regardless of the value of first_name. That’s because the else is at the same level of
indentation as the first if-statement, indicating that the else is associated with the first if-statement.
In listing 13.2, the else is associated (via indentation) with the second if-statement. Thus, the
program outlined in 13.2 will only report a burglar when last_name is equal to "Monster," but first_name is not equal to "Cookie." If last_name is not equal to "Monster", then the program
won’t print anything to the screen.</p>
