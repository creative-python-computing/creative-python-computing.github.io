<h1>10.1 Functions That Compute Values</h1>
<p>In <a href="../03/3_0_functions_intro.html">Chapter 3</a>, we introduced functions as a mechanism for supporting encapsulation. Functions allow us to write an algorithm that solves a specific sub-problem, gives that algorithm a name, and keeps the algorithm logically separate from the rest of a program. We provide inputs to functions by passing arguments when we make function calls.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’re going to learn how to write functions that have output as well. In a computer program, function output always takes the form of data. A function with output typically calculates some kind of result or answer, giving back whenever the function is called. An example of such a function is Python’s max() function. max() takes numbers as inputs and gives us back the single largest number from among its inputs, like so:</p>
<div class="linkContainer">

</div>
<p>The program above prints the value 6 to the console since 6 is the largest of the three values given as inputs to max().</p>
<p>We’ll come back to explain how to use functions with outputs shortly. But first, we’re going to see how to return output when we write our function definitions.</p>
