	<p>Very frequently in computer programming, we would like to repeat specific actions.
	  Sometimes we want to repeat these actions a specific number of times: drawing 1000 circles on
	  the screen. Other times, we want to repeat some actions if some specified condition (i.e., Boolean
	  expression) is True: for example, keep asking for a password until it is entered correctly.
	  Additionally, sometimes we'd like to repeat some action(s) for every element of data in some
	  collection of data elements: for example, for every student's grade in CS 20, give a 5% bonus. In
	  Python, we can do all these things using <strong>loops.</strong></p>
