<h1>3.3.8 Designing Programs with Functions</h1>
<p>One of the main purposes of functions is to make programs easier to design and read. Take a look at the following program in Processing. Can you figure out what it does just by looking at it?</p>

<p>Of course, you could copy this program into Processing and run it to see what you get, but even then, you would only know what the program does as a whole. If there was some small thing about the program’s behaviour that you wanted to change, you wouldn’t know where to start.</p>
<p>Here’s the same program, but organized into functions. Now can you guess what it might do?</p>

<p>Sure, the overall program is longer now since we had to type all of those function headers, but the organization is much better. And if you wanted to tweak this program — say you decided that the legs were too long — you know exactly where to start looking without messing up anything else. Of course, even this is just a straightforward example. Functions are even more useful when they have parameters that let us alter their behaviour in different circumstances, like with the line() function that Processing provides for us.</p>
