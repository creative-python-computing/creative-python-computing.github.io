	<h1>Chapter 3: Functions Introduction</h1>
	<p>Remember from Chapter 1, <a href="../01/1_9_Encapsulation.html">encapsulation</a> is the idea of giving a name to an algorithm and allowing us to refer to all of the instructions by merely referencing its name. Python allows us to do this through a mechanism called <strong>functions</strong>. Functions allow us to give a name to a block of Python code. If we implement an algorithm as a function in Python, we can run the algorithm by using the functionâ€™s name in a Python program. We refer to this process as <strong>calling</strong> the function.</p>
	<p><a href="3_1_Functions_Abstraction.html">Section 3.1</a> of this chapter introduces functions as a method of abstraction and their relationship to algorithms. <a href="3_2_Calling_Functions.html">Section 3.2</a> discusses the Python syntax for calling functions. Finally, <a href="3_3_Creating_Functions.html">section 3.3</a> introduces the Python language syntax for defining functions so that we can implement algorithms as functions.</p>
