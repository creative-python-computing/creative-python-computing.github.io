<h1>12.3.2 Ranges and Counting For-Loops</h1>
<p>We can use for-loops to create counting loops just like we did with while-loops. To do so, we first need to learn about a new kind of sequence called a <strong>range</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>range</strong> is a sequence of integers that begins at an integer a (the start), ends before an integer b
  (the stop), and the difference between each element in the sequence, called the step size, is equal.
  For example, the range starts at 1, stops at 5 and has a step size of 1 is comprised of the sequence of
  integers 1, 2, 3, 4. Ranges are created with Pythonâ€™s built-in range() function. The range
  function requires two arguments, start and stop, and can optionally accept a third argument for the
  step size, which, if not given, defaults to 1. You may also provide just a single argument to range;
  range(x) is equivalent to range(0, x, 1), and is the sequence 0, 1, 2,..., x - 1. Here are some
  example ranges:</p>

<p>Remember: the value stop is not part of the sequence.</p>
<p>Ranges can be used to write counting for-loops. Here is a for-loop that repeats its block exactly
  N times:</p>

<p>In the above loop, i refers to the value 0 on the first repetition, 1 on the second repetition, and so on, up
to N-1 on the last repetition. It is equivalent to the following while-loop:</p>
