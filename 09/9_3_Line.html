	<h1>9.3 Maximum Line Length and Line Breaking</h1>
	<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" target="new">PEP 8</a> suggests lines should be limited to 79 characters. This is because it allows you to have multiple files open next to one another, while also avoiding line wrapping.<br>
	  Of course, keeping statements to 79 characters or less is not always possible. PEP 8 outlines ways to allow statements to run over several lines.<br>
	  If the code is contained in parentheses, Python will assume line continuation and you can just go to the next line:</p>

	<p>If line breaking needs to occur around binary operators, like + and *, it should occur before the operator. This rule stems from mathematics.</p>

	<p>Breaking before binary operators produces more readable code, so PEP 8 encourages it. Code that consistently breaks after a binary operator is still PEP 8 compliant. However, youâ€™re encouraged to break before a binary operator.</p>
